AYCI is a multi-utility application that is basically AI Powered Messenger, features enhanced security with Facial Recognition, personalized conversations with your e-buddy; AYCI the chatBro, which also analyzes your sentiments and provides socially active Group Chats letting you chat with people connected on the same server as yours. Icing on the cake; to implement NLP, we did not use any module, but implemented a self made language processing algorithm to understand and process the data based on our own needs that too all in python only.
